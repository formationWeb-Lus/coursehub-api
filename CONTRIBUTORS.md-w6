## 👤 Individual Contributions – Jiresse Lusa (Week 06)

### 1. 🗃️ CRUD Operations for Final Two Collections with Validation
- Created full CRUD (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) endpoints for the final two collections: `courses` and `feedback`.
- Added data validation on all POST and PUT requests across **all four collections** using `express-validator`.
- Implemented proper error handling with try/catch blocks and custom error responses for invalid requests or server errors.

### 2. 🔐 Secured Routes with OAuth and Protected Middleware
- Implemented Google OAuth using `passport-google-oauth20` strategy.
- Secured the POST and PUT routes of at least two collections (`courses` and `feedback`) to require authentication using JWT.
- Created middleware (`checkJWTToken`) to protect private endpoints and verify user tokens.

### 🧪 Unit Testing and Documentation
- Wrote 4 unit tests for GET routes using Jest and Supertest to ensure route functionality and database connectivity.
- Helped update the Swagger documentation to reflect the new collections and secure routes.
- Verified that `/api-docs` is live and functional on Render.
