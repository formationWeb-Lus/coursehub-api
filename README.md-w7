## 👤 Individual Contributions – Jiresse Lusa (Week 07)

### 1. 🔐 Developed Full CRUD API Routes with Validation and Error Handling
- Implemented the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes for the main resources of the application.
- Integrated input validation using `express-validator` to ensure the integrity and structure of incoming request data.
- Added centralized error handling with `handleErrors` middleware to catch and respond with clear error messages.

### 2. 🔓 Implemented Google OAuth Authentication
- Set up `passport.js` with the `passport-google-oauth20` strategy to allow secure login via Google.
- Generated and managed JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.
- Created route protection middleware (`checkJWTToken`, `checkLogin`) to guard private pages such as `/account`.

### 🚀 Hosting & Documentation
